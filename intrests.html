                Cyperpunk Edgerunnersis a emotinal thiller of a show.
                Combines Drama and Actions in the well fleshed out world of Cyperpunk 2077.
                It's also great to see the refences to the game in the show and to the show in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                One Piece is the longest Anime to exsists and has been prited the most (funny cause the show is about prites).
                Its a great stroy about friendship and mayble a little anti-governemt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trigun: Stampede Is propbly the first fully 3D anime to do it right.
                I believe it deserves more attetion then it got as its a great show with a good animation and story.
                Give it a watch, trust me you won't reget it.
