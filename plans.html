                My futrue plans are in the air at the moment.
                I know when i graduate I will do work in the game development.
                I don't want to work in a AAA studio thou as employment there is allway under risk and indie games and making all the right moves as of recent.
                There is a lot going on in my life at the momnet so where or who I will be with in the future.
                I Will share what i know so far.

            <p>
                I the coming years I will pass all my college classes. I will (hopefully move out from here) and do game development in a indie studio. I also want to make a release my own video game before I graduate.
